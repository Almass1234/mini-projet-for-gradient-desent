# Gradient Descent Mini Project

This is a mini-project that implements the **Gradient Descent** optimization algorithm from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide a hands-on understanding of how gradient descent works in minimizing cost functions, especially in the context of linear regression.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost/loss function in machine learning and deep learning. This project demonstrates:

- Implementation of gradient descent from scratch (without libraries like scikit-learn).
- Application to a simple linear regression problem.
- Visualization of the convergence of the cost function.
- Optional: Comparison with analytical solution.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
